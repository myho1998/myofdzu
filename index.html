        <h1>US Migration</h1>
        <p> The United States is known as the biggest immigrant country because its population is far more multicultural, culturally varied, 
            and racial than in the past. Immigrants made up a record-breaking 44.8 million persons in the United States in 2018, accounting 
            for 13.7% of the total population. According to Alexandros Orphanides, a mixed-race journalist living in New York City, 
            the number of Americans who identify as mixed-race is growing three times faster than the total population. 
            On November 1, 2020, there were 3,762,891 applications on the waiting list in family-sponsored Preference Categories, 
            compared to 3,494,252 applicants on November 1, 2019. Because those immigrants are of many ethnicities and cultures, 
            there are several difficulties in their relationships with one another and with Americans. Through four literatures, 
            this study will investigate the integration and growth of immigrant children and second immigrant future generations in America, 
            as well as the disparities between those two generations in their integration to American society.</p>
